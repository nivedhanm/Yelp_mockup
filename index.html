                <ol>
                  <li><b>Yelp Icon:</b> The Yelp icon sybolically signifies a place that stands out from the rest, a place that people want to be at, a place that is special. Therefore instead of a trending icon, I chose to go with the yelp icon as a means to signify trending</li>
                  <li><b>Trending Page:</b> The trending screen showcases restaurants and other places that are regularly 'booked out' this information is curated by using the restaurant's reservation system</li>
                  <li><b>Surge indicator:</b> The indicator denotes that the restaurant is no currently experiencing surge pricing, like the $ icon, a higher number of icons indiactes a higher reservation surge price </li>
                  <li><b>Reservation Page:</b> The Reservation page is simlar to the existing reservation page. The main thing to change in this page is the surge indicator</li>
                  <li><b>Surge Notification:</b> The final surge indicator denotes the ongoing surge rate. The surge price is only for the reservation/ concierge fee and not on the price of the menu items</li>

          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p align ="justify">This is a prototype for showcasing a Surge Pricing business model. The thing about Yelp that kind of defied my logic was about how Yelp made money of the people who give its ratings till it struck home that they didn't. The money came in from the side of the business. On further research I found this to be the greatest criticism of yelp, that it didn't monetize the consumers. I had this in mind and remebered once when I was trying hard to get a reseravation for a date, and I was willing to shell out extra that the idea struck me. Why not have an uber like surge pricing model for restaurants and other limited capacity areas such as golf courses and movie theaters, if there is demand then people would pay, it is simple market economics </p>
          <p align ="justify">An additional motivation behind this idea was a friend of mine, who insisted on visiting all the hot new restaurants in town. He wanted to visit all the happening places and to check-in there. For him it would be great to be able to filter restaurants based on how many people go there, the more exclusive the better.</p>
          <p align ="justify">I therefore created this prototype  as a means to bring together these two needs. To allow people a way to bid higher to a place they wish to go and for the restaurant or organization to spread out their customers.</p>

                <h3>Testing the Idea</h3>
                <p align ="justify"> The maxim that was repeated often throughout my Lean Startup program was that "No Idea survives first contact with customers" so to confirm if I actually had a business model worth pursuing I went out and interviewed people, I called on 3 restaurants,  a golf course and 2 Laser Tag arenas. I also spoke to a professor of mine who played golf and a few students.</p>
                <p align ="justify"> I learnt from restaurants that their biggest problem with reservations is no shows. in fact the restaurants flat out refused to consider charging customers for reservations, mainly because the customers would just take their business else where. They expressed frustration over the fact that the customers could give them a bad rating but they still had to put up with them even if they don't show up and cost them on their margins</p>
                <p align ="justify"> I however had a more positive response from the golf course and laser tag arenas. they said that it would make sense to collect a higher reservation fee. They were confident that they wouldn't lose their clientele because there aren't many alternatives. but they said they would need to check when would be the best time to implement a surge pricing model. The Professor and students also mirrored this opinion, they said they might pay for the golf course or laser tag locations but they definitely wouldn't pay for a restaurant</p>

          <h3>Bringing it together</h3>
          <p align ="justify">The Idea in it's original form proves not to be most viable for restaurants, however it looks like the idea would be suitable for other limited access businesses.</p>
          <p align ="justify">But my conversation with the restaurants has brought me towards an interesting problem of how the restaurants are irritated over how one sided the rating is, This is an area I want to develop further on. I am currently on the drawing board trying to mock up a two way rating system that might allow the restaurants to prevent these no shows. I will be updating this mockup with more details soon.</p>
